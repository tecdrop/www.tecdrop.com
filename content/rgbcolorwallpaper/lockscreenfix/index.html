	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>By default, the Android wallpaper that is displayed on the Home screens, is also displayed on the Lock
           screen. However, some Android device manufacturers have decided to use a separate image for the Lock
           screen.</p>
        <p>(On Android 7.0 and above, RGB Color Wallpaper uses the new system functionality to set the color wallpaper
           on both the home screen and the lock screen.)</p>
        <p>If after running RGB Color Wallpaper, your lock screen is still not filled with color, follow the following
           simple steps:</p>

        <h2>1. Download the color wallpaper</h2>
        <p id="color-sample" style="width: 64px; height: 64px;"></p>
        <p><span id="wallpaper-info"></span><br />Don't worry, the image size should be only a few kilobytes.</p>
        <!--<p><a class="button" href="/img/apps/pitchblackwallpaper/help/pitch-black-image.png" download="pitch-black-image.png">Download</a></p>-->
        <p><button id="download-button" class="button">Download</button></p>

        <h2>2. Set the Lock screen wallpaper</h2>
        <p>Go to <i>Android Settings » Display » Lock screen wallpaper</i>, and pick the 
           <var>color-wallpaper.png</var> image you have just downloaded.</p>
        <p>That's it.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Is there an easier way to do this?</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately no. Having a separate image for the Lock screen is not the Android way of doing things, so there is no standard programmatic way to
           access this functionality from an app.</p>

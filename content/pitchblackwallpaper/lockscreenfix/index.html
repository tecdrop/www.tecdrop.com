		<p>By default, the Android wallpaper that is displayed on the Home screens, is also displayed on the Lock screen. However, some Android device
           manufacturers have decided to use a separate image for the Lock screen.</p>
        <p>(On Android 7.0 and above, Pitch Black Wallpaper uses the new system functionality to set both the home screen and lock screen wallpaper to
           pitch black.)</p>
        <p>If after running Pitch Black Wallpaper, your lock screen is still not black (pitch black), follow the following simple steps:</p>

        <h2>1. Download the Pitch Black image</h2>
        <p>If the image does not download when tapping the button, long tap it instead and select <i>Save Link</i>. Don't worry, the image size is less than
           half a kilobyte!</p>
        <p><a class="button" href="/img/apps/pitchblackwallpaper/help/pitch-black-image.png" download="pitch-black-image.png">Download</a></p>

        <h2>2. Set the Lock screen wallpaper</h2>
        <p>Go to <i>Android Settings » Display » Lock screen wallpaper</i>, and pick the <var>pitch-black-image.png</var> image you have just downloaded.</p>
        <p>That's it.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Is there an easier way to do this?</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately no. Having a separate image for the Lock screen is not the Android way of doing things, so there is no standard programmatic way to
           access this functionality from an app.</p>

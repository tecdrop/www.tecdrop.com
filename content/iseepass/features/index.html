		<p>Type a password in your browser, or let it save your passwords, and you will see asterisks. All passwords are hidden even from your eyes. Click the
           ISeePass bookmarklet, and all passwords on the page are revealed. Click it again, and the asterisks (and your privacy) are restored.</p>
        <p>Did you forget your password, and while your browser knows and auto-fills it, you just can't see beneath all those asterisks? Are you convinced that
           you are typing in the right password, but your browser says it's wrong, and there is no quick way to show what you are typing? Just drag and drop
           the ISeePass bookmarklet to your bookmarks toolbar, and simply click on it when you need X-ray vision to see or copy the hidden passwords from the
           current page.</p>
        <h2>No More Digging</h2>
        <p>The usual way to recover forgotten passwords requires quite a bit of digging into your browser settings. Wouldn't it be nice to have a password
           revealer at hand that helps you view them with just a click? And then hides them again with another? That's just what ISeePass does for you.</p>
        <h2>Forgotten Passwords</h2>
        <p>As long as you use the browser that has your saved passwords, its effortless to log in. But what if you want to log in using a different browser
           or device? Instead of trying to excavate the password from a hidden chamber of your memory, just click on the ISeePass bookmarklet.</p>
        <h2>"Wrong Password"</h2>
        <p>Even when you are 100% sure that you are typing in the right password, stuff can happen and get access denied. How to prove your browser wrong when
           it only shows you asterisks? Just click the ISeePass bookmarklet to view the actual characters typed in the password box.</p>
        <h2>New Accounts</h2>
        <p>When you sign up for a new account on a social network or online service, you have to enter your new password twice, as confirmation. But how can be
           sure you have entered the same password in both places, if all you see is asterisks? Use ISeePass to bypass the asterisks.</p>
        <h2>Simple and Minimal</h2>
        <p>ISeePass is designed to be as simple and straightforward as possible. As a bookmarklet (a bookmark stored in a web browser that contains JavaScript
           commands to extend the browser's functionality), it uses the minimum amount of resources, and doesn't slow down the browser.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tecdrop is a software startup born of a passion to create and liberate tiny, minimalist and portable programs and apps. The founder believes that
		   there is a tiny size solution for many existing issues users may face, and strives to explore what new tools could help users make the most of their
		   devices and the Internet.</p>
		<p>The Tecdrop apps tend to be free, tiny, minimalist, portable, and very light on resources. The large ones can be measured in kilobytes, while the
		   smallest ones can be measured in... bytes!</p>
		<p>So far, they are running on Windows, Android and, courtesy of the Web platform, on iOS, Mac OS, Linux, and more. This means desktop PCs, laptops,
		   tablets, smartphones, and more.</p>
